-  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m GhodratRezaei, Computer Vision Engineer at [Danieli Group](https://www.danieli.com/). graduated Data Science Student at [Politecnico di Milano University](https://www.polimi.it/)
-  Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and Computer Vision.
-  Main programming languages for the projects are python(Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Snap7, openCV, dash, ...), java, MATLAB, SQL and NoSQL(NEO4j,
MongoDB, cassandra, Kibana), Hadoop, PostMan API.
-  For the Computer Vision subjects, projects have been done using classical Computer Vision technoques( python(openCV),
MATLAB, photomodeller,Agisoft Metashape, Laser Scanner, CloudComapre, ...) and Artificial Intelligence( Deep Learning Approaches( Object detection(YOLOv3, YOLOv4,YOLOv5),
Semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, ...)
-  I am looking forward to hear from you for any collaboration.
